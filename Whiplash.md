# Whiplash
Arthur Dent’s reaction to earth being blown up is shockingly similar to how one commonly feels on a Monday. Tired. He describes the feeling as a military camp, because “part of me is always passed out”. {pg. 35}  
  
  At the beginning of the book, Arthur is arguing with the city council about having his home destroyed by a bypass. This goes from bad to 'what in the name of the queen' when his friend, Ford Prefect, who’s actually an alien, gets him drunk beyond rationale. While this is going on, all the radios come on to announce that the Earth is getting slam dunked into the bin, because the aliens need to build a space highway.   
    
    
  Once Arthur wakes up and finds out the news, instead of being shocked at Earth being gone, he basically suffers the equivalent of trying to do a math test on 2 milliseconds of sleep. He’s trying to process the situation, but he can’t fully do so.
