# Physics
I don’t think anybody likes a smart-aleck. They’re always so obnoxious, always trying to be the smartest one in the room and failing miserably, humiliating and ostracizing themselves in the process. But what if they ended up making a very important invention?<br>
<br>
In the book, the interstellar ship Heart Of Gold (which rescues Arthur and Ford from dying in space) is powered by an Interstellar Improbability drive. The way the drive works is that it generates finite improbability through hooking up the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in Brownian motion; this motion could be produced through suspending it in tea.<br>
<br>
These were commonly understood and used at parties in order to… move clothes. Physicists objected to this, saying that it was a debasement of science and also only possible on a small scale, meaning you couldn’t power a spaceship. One day, a student was cleaning up the mess from a party when they realized that if it’s virtually impossible, it’s logically also finitely improbable.<br>
<br>
The student calculated the improbability of the larger version existing, and fed that into a small scale device. The device was then given a fresh cup of strong tea, and it ended up working, meaning that the scientists were wrong.<br>
<br>
The student ended up lynched after winning an award, due to everyone realizing he was a total smart-aleck.<br>
<br>
This is such a good joke. While Douglas Adams loved science, he also liked to make fun of it a lot (see Philosophy for another example). The entire premise is mocking scientists for being so uptight, claiming something is impossible, and then when it’s done, immediately denouncing it as fake.
