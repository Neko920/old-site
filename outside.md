# Outside {#out}
The very beginning of the book starts out with Arthur Dent having a hangover like no hangover before, and having to take an Ibuprofen in order to clear it up. After this, he goes to a wardrobe mirror in order to look at himself. Then, we get the punchline.  
  
“The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with. 15 seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path”.  
  
The joke is the flash-forward that is used. It’s used in order to get the reader to go ‘wait, what?’ and re-read. Once they process it, it becomes funny. It’s a quick bait-and-switch of sorts. You expect there to be more leading off of the sentence, but instead it drops you into a completely different situation than what was expected. It’s actually ironic. It gets the reader to expect a tense buildup, but instead there isn’t. It’s almost like a drop in music, except the drop just occurs instead of there being any buildup.
