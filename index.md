# Don't Panic!
In 1978, the first radio brodcast of The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy was done. From that, a giant franchise exploded, with novels, films, comic books, merchandise, and even games. Even after the death of Douglas Adams in 2001, it is still one of the most popular BBC franchises ever. This serves as a companion book to the first novel, released in 1979.  
  
I think we somewhat forget the fact that most popular media wasn't originally on the internet. It was originally books, radio, TV, records, or even oral tradition. However, I also think that most preservation is too focused on books, with much newer tech now facing issues of preservation with things releated to DRM[^1], or just a general lack of focus with how resources should be delegated on projects. I should be able to do what I want, and I feel that that info is a great point as to why THGTTG resonates well with many people. Even aside the jokes that have now existed in pop culture much longer than I've been alive, it has a tinge of existentialism to it. Why are we here? What do we do? If we don't ponder these questions, our life can become boring. The questions have to come at some point, it's just a matter of when.  
  
Please enjoy going through how the book exibits irony, how it parodies philosophy, and how the craft of this book is unmatched.
