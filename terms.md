Hello! Welcome to this website-book. It took a while to make, and I hope that you like it. I do, however, have to define some terms in order to make sure that everyone understands.<br>
<br>
The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: The book this is about.<br>
<br>
The Guide: In the book, there is actually a Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, for which Ford Prefect works for. In order to distinguish between the book, and the book in the book, this is the name I chose. This is also apparently the name the book uses.<br>
<br>
Ford Prefect: The friend of Arthur Dent. An alien from outer space, pretending to be an out-of-work actor in order to write for The Guide. Manages to escape Earth along with Arthur Dent.<br>
<br>
Arthur Dent:  The protagonist of the book. A hapless guy, who at the beginning of the book has to deal with his house getting destroyed for a bypass, right before the Earth gets destroyed.
