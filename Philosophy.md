During Arthur and Ford’s stay in Vogon prison, Ford puts a fish in Arthur’s ear that allows him to hear every language. This fish, called the Babel fish, was also apparently used to show that god doesn’t exist due to the reasoning below.  


God refuses to prove he exists due to proof denying faith, and God is nothing without faith. But, the Babel fish is such an anomaly that it could not have evolved by chance. It had to have been created by God. Thus, God exists, but as stated, any proof that God exists shows that God does not actually exist.  

Aside from the horde of theological concerns this brings up, if we process this, we realize that this is a lot like the questions of philosophy. Philosophy is mainly concerned with answering questions, which is why science was originally natural philosophy before evolving into science. A big question of both theology and philosophy is “does a god exist?”.  

  
The next line takes a swerve in that it basically parodies the idea that everything is nothing in that “black is white”. It could be seen as a jab at Nihilists. But alas, we’ll just have to leave that question to the philosophers.
